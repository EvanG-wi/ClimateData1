#investigate effect of sulfur ban
#The goal of this project is to investigate the effect of regulations put into place in 2020 regulating sulfur content in fuel of shipping vessels
#explained in more detail in this post: https://twitter.com/RARohde/status/1676529805502693377
#bases on this post I hypothesized that the temperature in a region, with a baseline substracted, would go up starting from 2020
#if the region had high shipping vessel density.
#to do this I collected global temperature data, measured how it changed in the first 800 days after jan 1 2020
#then visually compared this to shipping traffic density from this source: https://moverdb.com/shipping-traffic-density/
#I wasn't able to identify any patterns in this analysis, I think the effect is too small relative to regular climate variance
